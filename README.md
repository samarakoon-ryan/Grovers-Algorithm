# Implementation of Grover's Algorithm using Qiskit

## Introduction

Grover's algorithm demonstrates the possibility of superior searching capabilities when used with a quantum computer. The algorithm is able to speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically. On a quantum computer, given a list of N items, we can find a marked item in $\sqrt{N}$ time.
